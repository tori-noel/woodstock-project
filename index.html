            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
              Hello! My name is Tori and I've lived in New York City for over a
              decade. Woodstock is my absolute favorite local get-away. It's
              perfect for romantic weekends, solo retreats and trips with
              friends. I created this page as part of a project for SheCodes
              Responsive to develop my coding skills.
